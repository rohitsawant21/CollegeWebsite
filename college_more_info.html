        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <p>I am grateful to the representative of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the work of Karmveer Vitthal
                    Ramji Shinde and keeping the representative reflection of the progress of the ‘shivraj’ that has
                    passed from the year 1964 to the Golden Jubilee. Our Shivraj has made an impression of our
                    independence in the educational, social, cultural and sports fields. Today, this college is known as
                    an ideal and perfect college. The leadership of the shaikshnik movement in rural areas has been able
                    to get thousands of students from self-sufficiency, self-control and self-government and have
                    continuously kept the lamp of knowledge in their life. Art, sports literature, commerce, science,
                    electronics, computers, science and technology are all in full swing. Now they are transformed into
                    ‘Shivraj Vidhya Sankul’. Many such students come enthusiastically for knowledge and knowledge, with
                    the degree of happiness, along with the degree of happiness, the stubbornness of life is realized.
